function optimizeUserData(users) {
    // Demonstrate efficiency awareness
    const userMap = new Map();
    const result = [];
    
    for (const user of users) {
        if (!userMap.has(user.email)) {
            userMap.set(user.email, user);
            result.push(user);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Async/Await Patterns (Critical for Node.js roles)
async function batchProcessUsers(userIds) {
    const BATCH_SIZE = 100;
    const results = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
        const batch = userIds.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
        
        // Process batches in parallel
        const batchResults = await Promise.all(
            batch.map(id => processUser(id))
        );
        
        results.push(...batchResults);
    }
    
    return results;
}

// System Design Implementation (Serverless focus)
class URLShortener {
    constructor() {
        this.cache = new Map(); // In practice: Redis
        this.database = new Map(); // In practice: DynamoDB
        this.analytics = new EventEmitter(); // In practice: EventBridge
    }
    
    async shortenURL(originalURL) {
        const shortCode = this.generateShortCode();
        
        // Store mapping
        await this.database.set(shortCode, {
            originalURL,
            createdAt: Date.now(),
            clickCount: 0
        });
        
        // Cache for performance
        this.cache.set(shortCode, originalURL);
        
        // Analytics event
        this.analytics.emit('url.shortened', { shortCode, originalURL });
        
        return `https://short.ly/${shortCode}`;
    }
    
    async expandURL(shortCode) {
        // Check cache first
        if (this.cache.has(shortCode)) {
            this.incrementClickCount(shortCode);
            return this.cache.get(shortCode);
        }
        
        // Fallback to database
        const data = await this.database.get(shortCode);
        if (data) {
            // Update cache
            this.cache.set(shortCode, data.originalURL);
            this.incrementClickCount(shortCode);
            return data.originalURL;

#### Negotiation Scripts and Strategies

**Script 1: Initial Offer Response**
```
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to [Company's] growth and help optimize your cloud infrastructure.

The role aligns perfectly with my experience in serverless architectures and cost optimization. I've successfully reduced cloud costs by $500k+ annually in previous roles.

Given my 21+ years of experience and the specific value I can bring - particularly in [specific area relevant to their challenges] - I was expecting a total compensation package in the range of $[X-Y]. 

Could we discuss how to bridge this gap? I'm flexible on the structure and would be interested in discussing equity, performance bonuses, or other creative solutions."
```

**Script 2: Multiple Offers Leverage**
```
"I want to be transparent - I have another compelling offer that includes [specific beneficial terms]. However, [Company] remains my preferred choice because of [specific reasons related to role/company].

The other offer is at $[amount] total compensation. While compensation isn't my only consideration, I'd need to be in a similar range to move forward. Is there flexibility in the current offer?"
```

**Script 3: Non-Salary Benefits Focus**
```
"I understand there may be constraints on the base salary. I'm interested in exploring other aspects of the package:

- Could we increase the equity component?
- Is there flexibility in the learning/conference budget?
- Would a signing bonus be possible to help with the transition?
- Can we discuss accelerated vesting or performance-based increases?"
```

**Script 4: Future Value Discussion**
```
"I see this as a long-term partnership. Given my track record of delivering $500k+ annual cost savings, I'm confident I can provide significant ROI within the first 6 months.

Could we structure something where my compensation increases based on demonstrated value delivery? For example, a performance review at 6 months with adjustment based on measurable impact?"
```

### Advanced Negotiation Tactics

#### Creating Leverage
1. **Multiple Opportunities**: Always have 2-3 offers in parallel
2. **Consulting Option**: "I could also continue consulting at $200/hour"
3. **Specialized Expertise**: Emphasize unique skill combination
4. **Immediate Impact**: Demonstrate quick win potential
5. **Market Timing**: Reference current demand for cloud skills

#### Timing Strategy
```markdown
## Negotiation Timeline:

### Week 1-2: Interview Process
- Focus on demonstrating value
- Research company challenges
- Build rapport with team
- Understand decision-making process

### Week 3: Offer Received
- Express enthusiasm first
- Request 24-48 hours to review
- Research company's recent funding/growth
- Prepare counter-proposal

### Week 4: Negotiation
- Present counter-proposal with justification
- Be prepared for back-and-forth
- Have compromise positions ready
- Get final offer in writing

### Week 5: Decision
- Make decision based on total value
- Negotiate start date if needed
- Confirm all terms in writing
- Professional communication throughout
```

#### Negotiation Psychology
**Do's:**
- Always express enthusiasm for the role first
- Use collaborative language ("How can we make this work?")
- Provide market data and justification
- Be prepared to walk away if necessary
- Focus on value delivered, not personal needs

**Don'ts:**
- Never accept first offer immediately
- Don't negotiate via email only
- Avoid ultimatums or aggressive tactics
- Don't reveal your current salary first
- Never lie about competing offers

### Special Situations

#### Remote Work Negotiation
```
"Given the nature of cloud architecture work and my experience with distributed teams, I'm looking for a primarily remote arrangement. This actually benefits [Company] through:

- Access to broader talent pool (you're getting the best, not just local)
- Reduced office overhead costs
- Flexible coverage across time zones
- Focus time for deep technical work

I'm happy to travel to the office for team meetings, planning sessions, and client meetings as needed - perhaps 1-2 days per month initially."
```

#### Contract-to-Hire Negotiation
```
"I'm open to a contract-to-hire arrangement, but given the uncertainty, I'd need:

- Higher hourly rate ($X/hour vs typical $Y for permanent)
- Shorter evaluation period (3 months maximum)
- Clear conversion criteria and process
- Guaranteed benefits during contract period
- Option to convert at current market rate, not discounted rate"
```

#### Startup Equity Negotiation
```
"I'm excited about [Startup's] potential and want to align my success with the company's growth. Given my 21+ years of experience and ability to scale technical infrastructure, I'd like to discuss equity that reflects my senior contribution level.

Based on my research of similar stage companies, I was expecting equity in the X-Y% range. I'm also interested in discussing:

- Vesting acceleration for performance milestones
- Equity refresh grants tied to company growth
- Exercise price protection in down rounds"
```
