# Cloud Service Architecture Approaches

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the three main cloud service architecture approaches covered in this roadmap. Each folder represents a different paradigm for building cloud applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Approaches Comparison

| Approach | Folder | Best For | Key Benefits | Complexity |
|----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Function as a Service** | `01-function-as-service` | Event-driven, short tasks | Cost-effective, auto-scaling | Low |
| **Container as a Service** | `02-container-as-service` | Long-running, complex apps | Portable, full control | Medium |
| **Hybrid Architecture** | `03-hybrid-serverless-container` | Enterprise applications | Best of both worlds | High |

## üìÅ Folder Structure Breakdown

### 01 - Function as a Service (FaaS)
**Focus**: Serverless computing with functions
- **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions
- **Use Cases**: APIs, event processing, scheduled tasks
- **Learning Time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge

### 02 - Container as a Service (CaaS)  
**Focus**: Container orchestration and management
- **Technologies**: Kubernetes, Docker, ECS, EKS, AKS, GKE
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, web applications, data processing
- **Learning Time**: 4-6 weeks
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of containers and networking

### 03 - Hybrid Serverless Container
**Focus**: Combining serverless and container technologies
- **Technologies**: Mixed stack with orchestration
- **Use Cases**: Complex distributed systems, enterprise applications
- **Learning Time**: 6-8 weeks
- **Prerequisites**: Proficiency in both FaaS and CaaS

## üé™ When to Choose Each Approach

### Choose Function as a Service When:
- ‚úÖ Building event-driven applications
- ‚úÖ Need automatic scaling with zero maintenance
- ‚úÖ Have unpredictable or variable workloads
- ‚úÖ Want to minimize operational overhead
- ‚úÖ Building simple APIs or microservices

### Choose Container as a Service When:
- ‚úÖ Need long-running processes
- ‚úÖ Have complex application dependencies
- ‚úÖ Require full control over the runtime environment
- ‚úÖ Building traditional web applications
- ‚úÖ Need to migrate existing applications

### Choose Hybrid Approach When:
- ‚úÖ Building complex distributed systems
- ‚úÖ Need different scaling patterns for different services
- ‚úÖ Want to optimize costs across different workloads
- ‚úÖ Have diverse technology requirements
- ‚úÖ Building enterprise-grade applications

---

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Function as a Service
- **Pricing Model**: Pay-per-invocation + execution time
- **Best for**: Variable, unpredictable workloads
- **Cost Range**: $0.0001 - $0.01 per request

### Container as a Service
- **Pricing Model**: Pay for compute resources (CPU/Memory)
- **Best for**: Consistent, predictable workloads
- **Cost Range**: $20 - $200+ per month per service

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Pricing Model**: Mixed based on service type
- **Best for**: Optimized cost across different workload patterns
- **Cost Range**: Varies based on architecture decisions
