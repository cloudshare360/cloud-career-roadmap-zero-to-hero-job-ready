# Immediate Job Acquisition Strategies

## Strategy Overview
**Timeline**: 2-8 weeks to job offers
**Goal**: Multiple strategic approaches to maximize employment opportunities
**Your Advantage**: 21+ years experience + AWS Lambda + Node.js/TypeScript

---

## Strategy 1: Serverless Specialist Fast Track (Highest Success Probability)

### Why This Strategy Works
- **Leverage existing skills**: You already have AWS Lambda + Node.js experience
- **High market demand**: Serverless developer roles growing 45% annually
- **Quick wins**: Can demonstrate expertise immediately
- **Lower competition**: Fewer developers have practical serverless experience

### Week 1-2: Skill Enhancement Sprint
#### Advanced Lambda Mastery
```javascript
// Build these advanced patterns immediately:

// 1. Lambda with API Gateway + DynamoDB CRUD
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const { httpMethod, pathParameters, body } = event;
    const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
    
    switch (httpMethod) {
        case 'GET':
            return await getUser(pathParameters.id);
        case 'POST':
            return await createUser(JSON.parse(body));
        case 'PUT':
            return await updateUser(pathParameters.id, JSON.parse(body));
        case 'DELETE':
            return await deleteUser(pathParameters.id);
    }
};

// 2. Event-driven processing with S3 triggers
exports.s3Handler = async (event) => {
    for (const record of event.Records) {
        const bucket = record.s3.bucket.name;
        const key = record.s3.object.key;
        
        // Process uploaded file
        await processImage(bucket, key);
        
        // Send notification
        await sendNotification(`Processed ${key}`);
    }
};

// 3. WebSocket real-time application
exports.websocketHandler = async (event) => {
    const { requestContext, body } = event;
    const connectionId = requestContext.connectionId;
    
    // Broadcast to all connected clients
    await broadcastMessage(connectionId, JSON.parse(body));
};
```
