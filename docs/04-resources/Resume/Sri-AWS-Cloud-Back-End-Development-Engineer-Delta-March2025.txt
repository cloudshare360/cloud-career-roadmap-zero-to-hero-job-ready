PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE


Client: Delta Airlines - Xebia | Sr. Cloud Architect, Sr. Cloud Engineer – Development | | June 2024 to Till Date| Worked Remotely: Dallas, TX
FFC Flight Family Communicator- Azure to AWS Migration

Delta Air Lines (“Delta”) has requested AWS Professional Services (ProServe) to review and assess the Delta Flight Family Communication (FFC) application for migration to AWS services. Delta seeks to reduce multi-cloud complexity by focusing on a single cloud platform —AWS cloud— to run more than 700 apps, including FFC. While some applications may remain in Azure or on-premise, the objectives of Delta’s single cloud strategy are to reduce total cost of ownership in the cloud and to improve security and resiliency/availability. Delta also seeks to enhance FFC to meet availability and recovery objectives for mission-critical applications. 

FFC is a cross-divisional project that seeks to improve operational communication. FFC provides employees with better visibility into operational information for the status of a flight via messaging. FFC helps Delta employees streamline the departure process, spend more time engaging with customers in a meaningful, individualized way, and improve on-time performance. Currently, Delta hosts FFC in a hybrid environment across on-premise data centers and Azure Cloud. The backend application depends heavily on Azure and Microsoft SDKs. 



FFC Azure to AWS is a 3-tire application, where front-end is developed in Angular, backed is developed using NodeJS, Express JS, Clients are using Java.
In Azure it is deployed using Azur APP which is equivalent of Elastic Bean Stack. As part of the Migration, the existing functionality, express API are converted as Lambda. The Enterprise Service Bus is replaced with Kafka

Roles: Architecture
As part of Migration, Converting the application to Lambda Architecture
Build a new Architecture which includes AWS Services viz. API Gateway, S3, Lambda, Postgres DB
