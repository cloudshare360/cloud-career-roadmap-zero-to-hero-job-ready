        return userService.findAllUsers()
            .delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    }
    
    // Modern validation and error handling
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody CreateUserRequest request) {
        return userService.createUser(request)
            .map(user -> ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(user))
            .orElse(ResponseEntity.badRequest().build());
    }
