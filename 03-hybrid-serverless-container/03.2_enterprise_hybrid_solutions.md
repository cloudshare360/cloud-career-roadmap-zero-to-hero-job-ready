## Enterprise Solution Framework

### Tier 1: Fortune 500 Transformation Strategy

#### Common Enterprise Scenarios
1. **Legacy Modernization**
   ```
   Challenge: Mainframe/legacy applications to cloud
   Solution: Hybrid approach with containers for core services,
            serverless for new features and integration
   Timeline: 18-36 months
   Budget: $10M-$100M
   Your Role: Lead architect or technical advisor
   ```

2. **Digital Transformation**
   ```
   Challenge: Traditional business models to digital-first
   Solution: API-first architecture with hybrid compute,
            event-driven integration, modern data platforms
   Timeline: 12-24 months
   Budget: $5M-$50M
   Your Role: Technical strategy lead
   ```

3. **Cost Optimization**
   ```
   Challenge: Cloud costs growing faster than business value
   Solution: Workload right-sizing, hybrid deployment optimization,
            automated cost governance
   Timeline: 6-12 months
   Budget: $2M-$20M (saves 40-60% of current spend)
   Your Role: Cost optimization architect
   ```

#### Enterprise Architecture Patterns

##### Pattern 1: Strangler Fig Modernization
```
Legacy Monolith → Hybrid Migration → Modern Architecture

Phase 1: API Gateway + Lambda (new features)
Phase 2: Extract services to containers (ECS/EKS)
Phase 3: Event-driven integration (EventBridge)
Phase 4: Data modernization (hybrid data stores)
Phase 5: Legacy retirement

Timeline: 24-36 months
Risk: Low (gradual migration)
Cost: Medium (parallel systems during transition)
```

##### Pattern 2: Greenfield Digital Platform
```
New Digital Platform → Full Hybrid Architecture

Core Services: Containers (EKS) for business logic
Integration Layer: Lambda for event processing
Data Layer: Hybrid (RDS + DynamoDB + S3)
Frontend: Static hosting + CDN
Analytics: Mixed (Lambda + EMR/EKS)

Timeline: 12-18 months
Risk: Medium (new architecture)
Cost: High (full build-out)
```

##### Pattern 3: Multi-Brand Platform Consolidation
```
Multiple Legacy Systems → Unified Hybrid Platform

Shared Services: Containers (multi-tenant architecture)
Brand-specific Features: Lambda (rapid deployment)
Data Integration: Event-driven (cross-system sync)
User Experience: API Gateway + CDN

Timeline: 18-24 months
Risk: High (complex integration)
Cost: Very High (enterprise-scale transformation)
```

### Tier 2: Mid-Market Solutions (500-5000 employees)

   - Budget: $1M-$5M

2. **E-commerce Modernization**
   - Current: Traditional e-commerce platform
   - Target: Event-driven, scalable hybrid architecture
   - Timeline: 6-9 months
   - Budget: $500k-$3M

3. **Data Analytics Platform**
   - Current: On-premises data warehouse
   - Target: Cloud-native analytics with hybrid compute
   - Timeline: 6-12 months
   - Budget: $1M-$8M
