# 03 - Hybrid Serverless Container

## Overview
This folder contains resources, examples, and projects that combine **Serverless (FaaS)** and **Container (CaaS)** technologies to create powerful hybrid architectures. This approach leverages the best of both worlds for optimal application design.

## What is Hybrid Serverless Container Architecture?
Hybrid Serverless Container architecture combines serverless functions with containerized services to create flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. This approach allows you to choose the right technology for each specific use case within the same application.

## Key Characteristics
- **Technology diversity**: Use functions and containers where each excels
- **Event-driven integration**: Seamless communication between components
- **Optimized cost structure**: Pay-per-use for functions, predictable costs for containers
- **Flexible scaling**: Different scaling strategies for different components
- **Service mesh integration**: Unified networking and observability
- **Polyglot architecture**: Different technologies for different requirements

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Function-Container Orchestration
- **Functions as triggers**: Lambda/Functions triggering container workloads
- **Container as backend**: Containers handling complex processing triggered by functions
- **Hybrid APIs**: Function-based simple endpoints, container-based complex APIs

### 2. Event-Driven Hybrid Systems
- **Serverless event routing**: Functions handling events and routing to containers
- **Container-based processing**: Long-running containers for data processing
- **Function-based notifications**: Lightweight functions for alerts and notifications

### 3. Microservices with Mixed Technologies
- **Authentication service**: Serverless functions for JWT validation
- **Business logic service**: Containers for complex business rules
- **Notification service**: Functions for real-time notifications
- **Data processing service**: Containers for heavy computational tasks

```
Frontend (Static) → API Gateway → Lambda (Auth) → ECS (Catalog Service)
                                ↓
                              SQS → Lambda (Order Processing) → RDS
                                ↓
                              SNS → Lambda (Notifications)
```

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
```
S3 Upload → Lambda (Trigger) → ECS Task (Heavy Processing) → Lambda (Cleanup)
     ↓                                    ↓
DynamoDB (Metadata)              CloudWatch (Monitoring)
```

### 3. IoT Processing System
```
IoT Devices → API Gateway → Lambda (Validation) → Kinesis → ECS (Analytics)
                    ↓                               ↓
                DynamoDB                    Elasticsearch
                    ↓                               ↓
            Lambda (Alerts)                 Lambda (Reporting)
```

## Decision Framework: When to Use What?

### Use Serverless Functions When:
- ✅ **Stateless operations** (< 15 minutes)
- ✅ **Variable/unpredictable workloads**
- ✅ **Event-driven processing**
- ✅ **Simple business logic**
- ✅ **Cost optimization for sporadic use**

### Use Containers When:
- ✅ **Long-running processes** (> 15 minutes)
- ✅ **Consistent workloads**
- ✅ **Complex dependencies**
- ✅ **Stateful applications**
- ✅ **Existing containerized applications**

### Use Hybrid When:
- ✅ **Different scaling requirements per service**
- ✅ **Mixed workload patterns**
- ✅ **Cost optimization across services**
- ✅ **Technology diversity requirements**
- ✅ **Complex distributed systems**

## Best Practices for Hybrid Architecture

### 1. Communication Patterns
- **Asynchronous messaging**: Use queues and events for loose coupling
- **API Gateway**: Unified entry point for both functions and containers
- **Service mesh**: For container-to-container communication
- **Event sourcing**: Maintain state through events

### 2. Data Management
- **Database per service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event-driven data sync**: Use events to maintain consistency
- **Shared read models**: CQRS patterns for read optimization
- **Caching strategies**: Redis/ElastiCache for shared state

### 3. Monitoring and Observability
- **Distributed tracing**: X-Ray, Jaeger, or Zipkin
- **Unified logging**: Centralized log aggregation
- **Metrics correlation**: Connect function and container metrics
- **Health checks**: Comprehensive service health monitoring

### 4. Security Considerations
- **Identity propagation**: JWT tokens across services
- **Network isolation**: VPC/VNET security groups
- **Secrets management**: Centralized secret storage
- **Compliance**: Data governance across hybrid architecture
