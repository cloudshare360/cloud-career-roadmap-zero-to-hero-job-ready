## Integration with Existing Skills

### Serverless + Containers Hybrid Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Event-Driven Microservices
```
API Gateway → Lambda (Auth) → EKS Services (Business Logic)
                ↓
            EventBridge → Lambda (Notifications)
```

#### Pattern 2: Background Processing
```
Container App → SQS → Lambda (Async Processing)
                ↓
          RDS/DynamoDB (Results)
```

#### Pattern 3: Data Pipeline
```
S3 → Lambda (Trigger) → EKS Job (Heavy Processing) → Lambda (Cleanup)
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Use Fargate for variable workloads**: No server management
2. **Use EC2 for consistent workloads**: Lower costs for steady state
3. **Combine with Lambda**: Use functions for lightweight operations
4. **Spot instances**: 70% cost savings for non-critical workloads
