#### Experience Section Optimization
```
Instead of: "Developed applications using Java and AWS"

Use: "Architected and implemented serverless solutions serving 500k+ daily active users, resulting in:
• 45% reduction in infrastructure costs ($120k annual savings)
• 99.9% uptime improvement through event-driven architecture
• 60% faster deployment cycles using AWS Lambda and CI/CD

Technologies: AWS Lambda, Node.js, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFormation"
```

### Phase 2: Content Strategy (Weeks 2-4)

#### Daily Content Framework

**Monday: Problem/Solution Posts**

"🚨 PROBLEM: [Common cloud/serverless challenge]

Most companies struggle with [specific issue]. Here's how I recently solved this for a client:

[Brief story with specific results]

💡 KEY LESSON: [Actionable insight]

What's the biggest [related challenge] your team faces?

#AWS #Serverless #CloudArchitecture #CostOptimization"

Example:
"🚨 PROBLEM: AWS Lambda cold starts killing user experience

A client's e-commerce app was losing customers due to 3-second load times from Lambda cold starts.

SOLUTION:
✅ Implemented connection pooling
✅ Added provisioned concurrency for critical functions
✅ Optimized bundle size (300kb → 50kb)
✅ Added warming strategies

RESULT: Load time dropped to 200ms, conversion rate increased 23%

💡 KEY LESSON: Cold start optimization can be a game-changer for user experience and business metrics.

What's your biggest Lambda performance challenge?

```

**Tuesday: Technical Insights**
```
Template:
"⚡ QUICK TIP: [Specific technical advice]

Why this matters: [Business impact]

Try it and let me know your results! 👇

#TechTip #AWS #Serverless"

Example:
"⚡ QUICK TIP: Reduce Lambda costs by 40% with this simple optimization

Instead of keeping connections open:
```javascript
// ❌ Don't do this
const db = new Database(connectionString);

// ✅ Do this
let db;
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    if (!db) {
        db = new Database(connectionString);
    }
    // Use db...
};
```

Why this matters: Connection reuse across invocations can cut your Lambda costs almost in half while improving performance.
